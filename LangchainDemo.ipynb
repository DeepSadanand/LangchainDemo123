With that purpose in mind, the Commissions will use the following basic definitions: \\n \\nProgram Educational Objectives – Program educational objectives are broad statements that \\ndescribe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years of graduation.  Program \\neducational objectives are based on the needs of the program’s constituencies.   \\nStudent Outcomes – Student outcomes describe what students are expected to know and be able \\nto do by the time of graduation.  These relate to the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that \\nstudents acquire as they progress through the program.  \\nAssessment – Assessment is one or more processes that identify, collect, and prepare data to \\nevaluate the attainment of student outcomes. Effective assessment uses relevant direct, indirect, \\nquantitative and qualitative measures as appropriate to the outcome being measured.  \\nAppropriate sampling methods may be used as part of an assessment process.  \\nEvaluation – Evaluation is one or more processes for interpreting the data and evidence \\naccumulated through assessment processes. Evaluation determines the extent to which student \\noutcomes are being attained. Evaluation results in decisions and actions regarding program \\nimprovement. \\n \\nThe criteria for accreditation are in two sections \\nGeneral Criteria – General Criteria apply to all programs accredited by an ABET commission.  Each \\nprogram accredited by an ABET commission must satisfy every Criterion that is in the General Criteria \\nfor that commission. \\nProgram Criteria – The Program Criteria provide discipline-specific accreditation criteria.  Programs \\nmust show that they satisfy all of the specific Program Criteria implied by the program title.  Any \\noverlapping requirements need be satisfied only once. \\n \\n \\n----------------------------- \\n \\nAll programs seeking accreditation from the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET must \\ndemonstrate that they satisfy all of the following General Criteria. \\n \\n \\n2 \\n '),\n",
